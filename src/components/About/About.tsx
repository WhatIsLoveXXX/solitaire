        Soli's journey with SolitaireAce.com began in the early 2020s. An avid
        solitaire player, he realized there was a gap in the market for a
        high-quality, immersive online solitaire game. He wanted to create a
        platform that was entertaining and provided a sense of community for
        solitaire lovers worldwide.

        The choice to develop a solitaire game was not random. Soli was always
        fascinated by the strategic depth and simplicity of solitaire. He
        believed that the game, despite its solitary nature, had the potential
        to connect millions of people across the globe. And so, he set out on
        his mission to bring solitaire into the digital age.
